Mininet installation notes for FreeBSD
--------------------------------------

Currently, the only option is native installation.

### Prerequisites

This Mininet port relies heavily on VIMAGE. VIMAGE is supported by FreeBSD 8.0
and later, so anything past 8.0 should work - with the caveat that Mininet has
only been tested so far on 10.3 and newer.

First and foremost, If it hasn't been already, the kernel must be recompiled with
the VIMAGE option in order for `jail` to be able to take advantage of virtual
network stacks (`vnet`s). A sample kernel configuration file, `VIMAGEMOD`, can
be found under `util/` of this repository. It also contains comments that describe
the minimum steps for recompiling a kernel.

To use resource limited hosts, `rctl` must be enabled. Add to /boot/loader.conf:

    kern.racct.enable=1

The system must be rebooted for this to take effect, so it's best to add this
before building a VIMAGE kernel (as you're rebooting anyways).

### Installation

Mininet is now available through the ports collection, so either should work:

    cd /usr/ports/net/mininet/ && make install clean   # build from ports tree
    pkg install py27-mininet                           # install package

Installing from source is also an option.

If they haven't been already, install `git` and `sudo`:

    pkg install git-lite sudo

Fetch the repo:

    git fetch https://github.com/akoshibe/mininet.git

The install script, `install.sh`, can be used to install Mininet, Open
vSwitch, and Ryu along with their dependencies. It must be generated first:

    cd mininet
    util/install.sh -a #or with flags -nvy

The script uses `pkg` to install the dependencies, so this should take just a
minute or so (plus or minus confirming installation, and network speed).

Next, start Open vSwitch (if not started):

    sudo service ovsdb-server onestart
    sudo service ovs-vswitchd onestart

The following lines can be added to /etc/rc.conf so that they start with
system startup/restart:

    ovsdb_server_enable="YES"
    ovs_vswitchd_enable="YES"

Finally, test the installation:

    sudo mn --test=pingall --controller=ryu

This should take about five or six seconds, a good chunk of which is waiting
for Ryu to start up. Alternatively, a `pingall` can be run from the CLI for a
similar sanity check with less waiting:

    sudo mn --controller=ryu
    mininet> pingall

### Removal

The Mininet core files can be uninstalled with the same install script:

    util/install.sh -u

This essentially undoes `install.sh -n`, minus the package dependencies.
