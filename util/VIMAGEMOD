# VIMAGEMOD - sample kernel configuration file for VIMAGE support in jails.
# 
# In general, the following steps should get you up and running with this
# configuration file:
#
# (assuming that this is amd64 and you have the sources)
# # cp VIMAGEMOD /usr/src/sys/amd64/conf/
# # cd /usr/src
# # make buildkernel KERNCONF=VIMAGEMOD
# # make installkernel KERNCONF=VIMAGEMOD
# (reboot)
# 
# If you have not compiled a kernel before, please refer to the following
# to get a better idea of what's involved:
